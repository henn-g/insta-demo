# CocoaPods Installation Walkthrough
## In this guide, we will be exploring how we go about installing *CocoaPods*, which is a package manager for iOS development

*Estimated time*: 5 min :bowtie:

CocoaPods is essential to install dependencies that your project needs. It offers packages ranging from network modules to user authentication packages. These all serve to make your life as a developer easier! Imagine manually trying to implement certain common services for your app, and there are existing packages that have been actively worked on for a much longer time that are much more efficiant and practical for your project's needs. - Spend about 2 minutes talking about the benefits of using this package mangement system.



### Context
CocoaPods is implemented with Ruby, and thus needs to be installed with *gem*. Note that this is similar to *pip* for all you pythonistas out there. No need to worry about going out on the internet to install gem or ruby altogether, OSX comes installed with both of those packages by default. 
### Install
Run `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
input your password when prompted to do so in the terminal.
That's it! :sunglasses:
- Should take about another minute for the majority of students to complete this part

*Note*: The remaining time will be allocated to helping students troubleshoot the install for CocoaPods, since there could be a variety of problems that could arise for various reasons. It's always good to allocate time for edge case problems and make sure that all students are on board with the lesson.
